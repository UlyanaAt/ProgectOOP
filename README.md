This is a simple game of luck. 
Player can choose from 3 categories: 
Magician, Assasin and Tank (they have different features), these roles have some characteristics, such as Luck, Strenght, Health and others.
Points of each characteristic are set randomly. After the player chooses a role for himself, an enemy with any of these three roles is created. 
Whoever has more total combat power (the sum of all characteristics) wins
